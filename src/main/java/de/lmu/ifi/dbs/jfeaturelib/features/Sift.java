/**
 * This descriptor is a wrapper class for the famous SIFT algorithm proposed by
 * David Lowe: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/
 *
 * Related papers:<br> The most complete and up-to-date reference for the SIFT
 * feature detector is given in the following journal paper:<br> David G. Lowe,
 * "Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints," International
 * Journal of Computer Vision, 60, 2 (2004), pp. 91-110.<br> The SIFT approach
 * to invariant keypoint detection was first described in the following ICCV
 * 1999 conference paper, which also gives some more information on the
 * applications to object recognition:<br> David G. Lowe, "Object recognition
 * from local scale-invariant features," International Conference on Computer
 * Vision, Corfu, Greece (September 1999), pp. 1150-1157.<br> The following
 * paper gives methods for performing 3D object recognition by interpolating
 * between 2D views. It also provides a probabilistic model for verification of
 * recognition.<br> David G. Lowe, "Local feature view clustering for 3D object
 * recognition," IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,

 * Patents:<br> Method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features in
 * an image and use of same for locating an object in an image<br> David G.
