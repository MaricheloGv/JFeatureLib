/**
 * Simple implementation of the Roberts(Cross)-Operator.
 *
 * The Roberts-Cross-Operator uses just 2x2 matrices instead of the alsmost
 * standard odd-sized kenrels.
 *
 * For sake of simplicity (and in order to conveniently use imageJ's convolve
 * method), the following 3x3 matrix is used which should produce the same
 * result as the 2x2 matrix (just a bit more inefficient):
 * <pre>
 * 0  0  0
 * 0  1  1
 * 0 -1 -1
 * </pre>
 *
 * See more information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_Cross
